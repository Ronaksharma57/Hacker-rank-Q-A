You will get two integer inputs x and y, you need to print “High Sum” if sum is greater than or equal to 100, and print “Low Sum” otherwise.

Input Format

You will get the value of x in the first line, You will get the value of y in the second line.

Constraints

-2^31 <= x,y <= 2^31 -1

Output Format

You need to print "High Sum" or "Low Sum" accordingly.

Sample Input 0

40
70
Sample Output 0

High Sum
Explanation 0

Value of x is 40, value of y is 70. So the sum is 110, since sum is greater than or equal to 100 so we print "High Sum"
