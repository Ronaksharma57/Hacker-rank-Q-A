Take input three numbers x, y, z as an integer input

Then if the value of x is greater than or equal to 20,

a. If the value of y is greater than or equal to 100 then add 100 to the value of z.

b. If the value of y is less than 100 and greater than or equal to 50, then add 50 to the value of z.

c. Else add 10 to the value of z.

Else if the value of x is less than 20,

a. If the value of y is greater than or equal to 100 then add 3 to the value of z.

b. If the value of y is less than 100 and greater than or equal to 50, then add 2 to the value of z.

c. Else add 1 to the value of z.

Print the final value of z as an integer output in the end.

Input Format

For each test case, Value of x as an integer input will be given in the first line Value of y as an integer input will be given in the second line Value of z as an integer input will be given in the third line

Constraints

0<=x,y,z<=2^31-1

Output Format

Print the final value of z as an integer output

Sample Input 0

30
120
30
Sample Output 0

130
Explanation 0

Since the value of x is 30 which is greater than or equal to 20, and the value of y is 120 which is greater than or equal to 100, so we add 100 to the value of z.

Sample Input 1

22
55
40
Sample Output 1

90
Explanation 1

Since the value of x is greater than or equal to 20, and the value of y is 55 which is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 100, so we print 50 to the value of z. Hence we print 90.
