Sample Input 0

65
25000
25
Sample Output 0

30000
Explanation 0

Since the age is greater than 60 and salary is greater than 20,000 and experience is greater than 20 years, so we add 5000 to the salary, hence we print 30000

Sample Input 1

30
15000
7
Sample Output 1

15500
Explanation 1

Since the age is 30, so none of the conditions follow, so we add 500 to the salary. Hence the final salary is 15500
