There are three friends A,B,C. You will be given the ages of these three friends as an integer input, you have to print the same of the oldest friend among them.

Input Format

For each test case, you will be given Age of A in the first line as an integer input Age of B in the second line as an integer input Age of C in the third line as an integer input

Constraints

0<=age<=2^31-1

Output Format

You have print A or B or C accordingly.
