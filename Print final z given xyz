Take in x, y, z as integer inputs from the user,

a. If x is greater than or equal to 20 and z is less than 100 then add 200 to the value of z.

b. If x is greater than or equal to 10, or y is less than 50 Then add 100 to the value of z.

In the end print the final value of z as an integer output.

Input Format

For each test case, you will get

Value of x as an integer input in the first line,

Value of y as an integer input in the second line,

Value of z as an integer input in the third line.

Constraints

-2^31<=x,y,z<=2^31-1

Output Format

You have to print the final value of z as an integer output.

Sample Input 0

25
30
80
Sample Output 0

280
Explanation 0

Since the value of x is 25 which is greater than or equal to 20, and the value of z is 80 which is less than 100, hence the first condition follows, so we 200 to the value of z and hence we print 80+200=280

Sample Input 1

25
45
190
Sample Output 1

290
Explanation 1

Here the second condition follows so we add 100 to the value of z, so z becomes 190+100=290.
