b. Else print “You are young”

Input Format

For each test case, You will get the age of the person in the first line as an integer input, You will get the salary of the person in the second line as an integer input.

Constraints

0<=age,salary<=2^31-1

Output Format

You have to print the output as a string accordingly.

Sample Input 0

45
35000
Sample Output 0

You are rich and adult
Explanation 0

Since the age is above 40 and the salary is greater than or equal to 30000, so we print "You are rich and adult"

Sample Input 1

35
10000
Sample Output 1

You are young
Explanation 1

Since the age is 30 which is less than or equal to 40 and salary is 10000 which is less than 12000, so we print "You are young"

Sample Input 2

41
30000
Sample Output 2

You are rich and adult
